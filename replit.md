## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens for consistent branding
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management and caching
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules for modern JavaScript features
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for request/response validation and type inference
- **Storage**: Abstract storage interface supporting both in-memory and database implementations
- **Development**: Hot module replacement and error overlays for improved developer experience

### Data Storage Solutions
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless) for production data persistence
- **Schema**: Shared TypeScript schemas between frontend and backend using Drizzle-Zod
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations and schema management
- **Fallback**: In-memory storage implementation for development and testing

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Current State**: No authentication system implemented
- **Storage**: Contact form submissions stored without user accounts
- **Security**: Basic input validation and sanitization through Zod schemas

### External Dependencies
- **Database Hosting**: Neon Database (PostgreSQL-compatible serverless database)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Inter, Poppins) for typography
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Image Hosting**: Unsplash for placeholder images and case study visuals
- **Development Tools**: Replit-specific plugins for development environment integration
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form ecosystem for form state management
- **Date Utilities**: date-fns for date formatting and manipulation
- **Styling**: PostCSS with Autoprefixer for CSS processing

The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns with shared TypeScript types between client and server, enabling full-stack type safety. The storage layer is abstracted to support multiple backends, making it easy to switch from development (in-memory) to production (PostgreSQL) environments.
